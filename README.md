# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Neural-Networks
This project aims to predict customer churn (i.e., whether a customer will leave or stay) using neural networks. It preprocesses the data, trains a neural network model, evaluates its performance, and visualizes the results using confusion matrices.


#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- tensorflow

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy scikit-learn seaborn tensorflow
```

#### Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Make sure you have the CSV file named "Churn_data.csv" in the same directory as the code.
3. Run the code using a Python interpreter.
4. The code will preprocess the data, train a neural network model, evaluate its performance, and display a confusion matrix visualization.

#### Features

- Preprocesses the dataset by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
- Builds and trains a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Evaluates the model's performance using binary cross-entropy loss and accuracy metrics.
- Visualizes the results using a confusion matrix to show the classification performance.
