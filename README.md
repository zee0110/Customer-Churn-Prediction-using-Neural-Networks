# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Neural-Networks
This project aims to predict customer churn (i.e., whether a customer will leave or stay) using neural networks. It preprocesses the data, trains a neural network model, evaluates its performance, and visualizes the results using confusion matrices.
